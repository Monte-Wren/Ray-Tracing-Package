ReadMe for raytracing package:

click on file -> open -> RayTracer_project.zip -> RayTracer.py

repeat for the other .py files in the zip file.
You may need to run the RayTracer.py code so it is imported into the other files.

Run the RayTracer_test_plots.py script to retrieve the test plots.
Run the RayTracer_investigations.py script for the plano-convex lens and optimizer function etc.

If you create a new python script and wish to play around, make sure to "import RayTracer as rt".
